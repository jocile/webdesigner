    Look at the stars
    Look how they shine for you
    And everything you do
    Yeah, they were all yellow
    I came along
    I wrote a song for you
    And all the things you do
    And it was called Yellow
    So then I took my turn
    Oh, what a thing to have done
    And it was all yellow
    Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
    Turn into something beautiful
    And you know, you know I love you so
    You know I love you so
    I swam across
    I jumped across for you
    Oh, what a thing to do
    'Cause you were all yellow
    I drew a line
    I drew a line for you
    Oh, what a thing to do
    And it was all yellow
    And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
    Turn into something beautiful
    And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
    For you, I'd bleed myself dry
    It's true

    Look how they shine for you
    Look how they shine for
    Look how they shine for you
